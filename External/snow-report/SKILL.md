# Snow Report

Fetch live snow conditions from OpenSnow for any ski resort worldwide.

## SnowTick — Mountain Tickers

4-letter codes for quick mountain lookups, like stock tickers:

| Ticker | Resort |
|--------|--------|
| `JHMR` | Jackson Hole |
| `TARG` | Grand Targhee |
| `MMTH` | Mammoth |
| `BIRD` | Snowbird |
| `ALTA` | Alta |
| `BOAT` | Steamboat |
| `WHIS` | Whistler |

Full list in `references/resorts.md`. Use tickers anywhere you'd use a resort name.

## Commands

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "snowtick" | Quick ticker tape of all favorites |
| "snow report" / "how's the snow" | Pull default mountain from user config |
| "snow at Mammoth" / "Jackson snow" | Pull specific resort |
| "JHMR" / "what's TARG at" | Pull by SnowTick code |
| "compare Jackson and Targhee" | Multi-mountain comparison |
| "compare JHMR TARG MMTH" | Compare by tickers |
| "powder alert" / "where's it snowing" | Check forecasts across favorites |

## User Configuration

Check `memory/snow-preferences.md` for user settings:

```markdown
# Snow Preferences

## Default Mountain
JHMR

## Favorites
- JHMR (Jackson Hole)
- TARG (Grand Targhee)
- MMTH (Mammoth)
- ALTA (Alta)

## Report Style
- compact (default) | detailed
- skip: parking
```

Tickers or slugs both work. If no config exists, ask user for their home mountain and create the file.

## Resolving Tickers

When user provides a ticker (4 uppercase letters):
1. Look up in `references/resorts.md`
2. Get the corresponding slug
3. Use slug for OpenSnow URL

Example: `JHMR` → `jacksonhole` → `opensnow.com/location/jacksonhole/snow-summary`

1. Read user favorites from memory/snow-preferences.md
2. Open all favorite resort tabs in parallel
3. Snapshot each tab for snow data
4. Extract: base depth, 5-day forecast, current conditions
5. Format as ticker tape with best bet arrow
6. Close all tabs

## First-Time Setup

If user asks for snow report with no config:

1. Ask: "What's your home mountain? I'll set it as your default."
2. Create `memory/snow-preferences.md` with their answer
3. Ask: "Any other favorites to add for comparisons?"
4. Pull their first report

## Notes

- OpenSnow is JS-rendered; browser required
- Data updates throughout day; morning reports freshest
- 11-15 day forecast may be paywalled (show what's visible)
- For resort-specific data (lifts, groomed runs), check resort's own site
