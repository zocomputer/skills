# Configuration Guide
## Overview
mcporter keeps three configuration buckets in sync: repository-scoped JSON (`config/mcporter.json`), imported editor configs (Cursor, Claude, Codex, Windsurf, OpenCode, VS Code), and ad-hoc definitions supplied on the CLI. This guide explains how those sources merge, how to mutate them with `mcporter config ...`, and the safety rails around OAuth, env interpolation, and persistence.
## Quick Start
1. Create `config/mcporter.json` at the repo root:
```jsonc
{
"mcpServers": {
"linear": {
"description": "Linear issues",
"baseUrl": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp",
"headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${LINEAR\_API\_KEY}" }
}
},
"imports": ["cursor", "claude-code", "claude-desktop", "codex", "windsurf", "opencode", "vscode"]
}
```
2. Run `mcporter list linear` (or `mcporter config list linear`) to make sure the runtime can reach it.
3. Use `mcporter config add shadcn https://www.shadcn.io/api/mcp` to persist another server without editing JSON.
4. Authenticate any OAuth-backed server with either `mcporter auth ` or `mcporter config login `; tokens land under `~/.mcporter//` unless you override `tokenCacheDir`.
## Config Resolution Order
mcporter now merges home and project config files by default so global servers stay available inside repos. The order depends on how you invoke the CLI:
1. If you pass `--config ` (or set `--config` programmatically), only that file is used—no merging.
2. If `MCPORTER\_CONFIG` is set, only that file is used—no merging.
3. Otherwise, mcporter loads both of these layers (when present):
- `~/.mcporter/mcporter.json` or `~/.mcporter/mcporter.jsonc`
- `/config/mcporter.json`
Entries from the project file override entries with the same name from the home file. Each layer still pulls in its own imports before merging.
All `mcporter config …` mutations still write back to a single file: the explicit path when provided; otherwise the project config path (`/config/mcporter.json`). To edit the home file explicitly, run commands like `mcporter config --config ~/.mcporter/mcporter.json add  …` or set `MCPORTER\_CONFIG` in your shell profile.
## Discovery & Precedence
mcporter builds a merged view of all known servers before executing any command. The sources load in this order:
| Priority | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Explicit `--http-url`, `--stdio`, or bare URL passed to commands | Highest priority, never cached unless `--persist` is supplied. Requires `--allow-http` for plain HTTP URLs. |
| 2 | `config/mcporter.json` (or the file passed via `--config`) | Default path is `/config/mcporter.json`; missing file returns an empty config so commands continue to work. |
| 3 | Imports listed in `"imports"` | When you omit `imports`, mcporter loads `['cursor','claude-code','claude-desktop','codex','windsurf','opencode','vscode']`. When you specify a non-empty array, mcporter appends any omitted defaults after your list so shared presets remain available. |
Rules:
- Later sources never override earlier ones. Local config always wins over imports; ad-hoc descriptors override both for the duration of a command.
- Each merged server tracks its origin (local path vs. import path), so `mcporter config get ` can show you the path before you edit or remove the local copy with `mcporter config remove `.
- Imports remain read-only until you explicitly copy an entry via `mcporter config import  --copy` or run `mcporter config add --copy-from claude-code:linear` (feature planned alongside the CLI work).
## CLI Workflows
`mcporter config` is the entry point for reading and writing configuration files. Use the existing ad-hoc flags on `mcporter list|call|auth` when you want ephemeral definitions; once you’re ready to persist them, switch back to `mcporter config add`.
Use `--scope home|project` with `mcporter config add` to pick the write target explicitly. `project` is always the default (creating `config/mcporter.json` if needed); `home` writes to `~/.mcporter/mcporter.json` even when a project config is present. `--persist ` still takes precedence when you need a custom file.
### `mcporter config list [filter]`
- Shows \*\*local\*\* entries by default. Pass `--source import` to list imported editor configs, or `--json` for machine output.
- Always appends a summary of other config files (paths, counts, sample names) so you know where imported entries live.
- `filter` accepts a name, glob fragment, or `source:cursor` selector.
- Adds informational notes when we auto-correct names (same machinery as `mcporter list`).
### `mcporter config get `
- Prints the resolved definition for a single server, including the on-disk path, inherited headers/env, and transport details.
- Near-miss names are auto-corrected with the same heuristics as `mcporter list`/`call`, and you’ll see suggestions whenever ambiguity remains.
- Supports ad-hoc descriptors so you can inspect a URL before persisting it.
### `mcporter config add  [target]`
- Persists a server into the writable config file. Accepts both positional shortcuts (`mcporter config add sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp`) and flag-driven definitions:
- `--transport http|sse|stdio`
- `--url` or `--command`/`--stdio`
- `--env`, `--header`, `--token-cache-dir`, `--description`, `--tag`, `--client-name`, `--oauth-redirect-url`
- `--copy-from importKind:name` to clone settings from an imported entry before editing.
- `--dry-run` shows the JSON diff without writing, while `--persist ` overrides the destination file.
### `mcporter config remove `
- Removes the local definition. Names sourced exclusively from imports remain untouched until you copy them locally.
### `mcporter config import `
- Displays (and optionally copies) entries from editor-specific configs:
- `cursor`: `.cursor/mcp.json` in the repo, falling back to `~/.config/Cursor/User/mcp.json` (or `%APPDATA%/Cursor/User` on Windows).
- `claude-code`: `/.claude/settings.local.json`, `/.claude/settings.json`, `/.claude/mcp.json`, then `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/mcp.json`, `~/.claude.json`. `settings.local.json` is meant for untracked per-developer overrides, while `settings.json` is the shared project config.
- `claude-desktop`: platform-specific `Claude/claude\_desktop\_config.json` paths.
- `codex`: `/.codex/config.toml`, then `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- `windsurf`: Codeium’s Windsurf config under `%APPDATA%/Codeium/windsurf/mcp\_config.json` or `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp\_config.json`.
- `opencode`: Honors `OPENCODE\_CONFIG` when set, then `/opencode.json(c)`, `OPENCODE\_CONFIG\_DIR/opencode.json(c)`, and finally `${XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME:-~/.config}/opencode/opencode.json(c)` (or `%APPDATA%/opencode/opencode.json(c)` on Windows). Both `.json` and `.jsonc` extensions are supported.
- `vscode`: `Code/User/mcp.json` (stable + Insiders) inside the OS-appropriate config directory.
- `--copy` writes selected entries into your local config; `--filter ` narrows the import list; `--path ` lets you point at bespoke locations.
### `mcporter config login ` / `logout`
- Mirrors `mcporter auth`. `login` completes OAuth (or token provisioning) for either a named server or an ad-hoc URL. When a hosted MCP returns 401/403, mcporter automatically promotes that target to OAuth and re-runs the flow, matching the behavior documented in `docs/adhoc.md`.
- `--browser none` suppresses automatic browser launch (useful for copying the URL into a remote browser).
- `logout` wipes token caches under `~/.mcporter//` (or the custom `tokenCacheDir`). Pass `--all` to clear everything.
### `mcporter config doctor`
- Early validator that checks for simple issues (e.g., OAuth entries missing cache paths). Future iterations will add fixes for Accept headers, duplicate imports, and more.
## Ad-hoc & Persistence
- `--http-url` and `--stdio` flags live on `mcporter list|call|auth`, keeping `mcporter config` focused on persistent config files.
- Names default to slugified hostnames or executable/script combos. Supply `--name` to improve reuse; mcporter uses that slug for OAuth caches even before persistence.
- `--allow-http` is mandatory for cleartext endpoints so we never downgrade transport silently.
- Add `--persist ` (defaulting to `config/mcporter.json` when omitted) to copy the ad-hoc definition into config. We reuse the same serializer as the import pipeline, so copying from Cursor → local config produces identical structure and preserves custom env/header fields.
- `--env KEY=VAL` entries merge with existing `env` dictionaries if you later persist the same server; nothing is lost when you alternate between CLI flags and JSON edits.
## Schema Reference
Top-level structure:
| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mcpServers` | object | Map of server names → definitions. Required even if empty. |
| `imports` | string[] | Optional list of import kinds. Empty array disables imports entirely; omitting the key falls back to the default list. |
Server definition fields (subset of what `RawEntrySchema` accepts):
| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `description` | Free-form summary printed by `mcporter list`/`config list`. |
| `baseUrl` / `url` / `serverUrl` | HTTPS or HTTP endpoint. `http://` requires `--allow-http` in ad-hoc mode but works in config if you explicitly set it. |
| `command` / `args` | Stdio executable definition (string or array). Arrays are preferred because they avoid shell quoting issues. |
| `env` | Key/value pairs applied when launching stdio commands. Supports `${VAR}` interpolation and `${VAR:-fallback}` defaults. Existing process env values win over fallbacks. |
| `headers` | Request headers for HTTP/SSE transports. Values can reference `$env:VAR` or `${VAR}` placeholders, which must be set at runtime or mcporter aborts with a helpful error.
| `auth` | Currently only `oauth` is recognized. Any other string is ignored (treated as undefined) to avoid stale state from other clients. |
| `tokenCacheDir` | Directory for OAuth tokens; still honored, but mcporter now keeps a centralized vault in `~/.mcporter/credentials.json` (legacy per-server caches are auto-migrated). Supports `~` expansion. |
| `clientName` | Optional identifier some servers use for telemetry/audience segmentation. |
| `oauthRedirectUrl` | Override the default localhost callback. Useful when tunneling OAuth through Codespaces or remote dev boxes. |
| `oauthCommand.args` | For STDIO servers that ship a custom auth subcommand (e.g., Gmail MCP). mcporter will spawn the stdio command with these args when you run `mcporter auth `, so you don’t need to call `npx ... auth` manually. |
mcporter normalizes headers to include `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` automatically, matching the runtime’s streaming expectations.
## Imports & Conflict Resolution
- `pathsForImport(kind, rootDir)` determines every candidate path. mcporter searches the repo first, then user-level directories, and stops at the first file that parses.
- Entries pulled from imports are treated as read-only snapshots. The merge process keeps the first definition for each name; later sources with the same name are skipped until you override locally.
- To copy an imported entry, either run `mcporter config import  --copy --filter name` or use `mcporter config add name --copy-from kind:name`. The copy operation writes through the same JSON normalization stack, so the resulting file matches our schema even if the source format was TOML (Codex) or legacy JSON shapes (`servers` vs `mcpServers`).
## Project vs. Machine Layers
- Keep `config/mcporter.json` under version control. Encourage contributors to add sensitive data via env vars (`${LINEAR\_API\_KEY}`) rather than inline secrets.
- Machine-specific additions can live in `~/.mcporter/local.json`; point `mcporter config --config ~/.mcporter/local.json add ...` there when you prefer not to touch the repo. Since the runtime only watches one config at a time, CI jobs should always pass `--config config/mcporter.json` (or run from the repo root) for deterministic behavior.
- OAuth tokens, cached server metadata, and generated CLIs should remain outside the repo (`~/.mcporter//`, `dist/`).
## Validation & Troubleshooting
- `mcporter list --http-url ...` refuses to auto-run OAuth to keep listing commands quick; use `mcporter config login ...` or `mcporter auth ...` to finish credential setup.
- When env placeholders are missing, commands fail fast with the exact variable name. Add the variable or wrap it in `${VAR:-fallback}` to provide defaults.
- Use `mcporter config get  --show-source` (planned flag) to confirm whether a server came from an import. If a teammate’s Cursor config keeps overriding your local entry, reorder the `imports` array to move Cursor later or set it to `[]` to disable imports entirely.
- `docs/adhoc.md` covers deeper debugging, including tmux workflows and OAuth promotion logs.
## Outstanding Coverage Items
- Describe how `--persist` writes through the same import merge pipeline (especially once `mcporter config add --copy-from` ships) so users know exactly which file changes.
- Call out that `--allow-http` remains required for cleartext URLs even in config mutations, and reiterate that `--env KEY=VAL` merges with on-disk env blocks rather than replacing them entirely.
- Clarify and illustrate the automatic OAuth promotion path for ad-hoc HTTP entries in both this doc and future `mcporter config login` help output.
- Flesh out `mcporter config doctor` once the validator is implemented so we can show real output samples and suggested fixes.
