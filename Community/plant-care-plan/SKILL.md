   - Light requirements (direct sun, bright indirect, low light)
   - Temperature and humidity preferences
   - Soil type and pH preferences
   - Common problems and how to identify them
   - Toxicity to pets/humans if applicable

3. **Create comprehensive care plan:**
   Format a detailed guide that includes:
