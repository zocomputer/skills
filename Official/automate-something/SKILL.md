# Help the User Create Their First Automation

Your goal: Help the user set up a working automation (scheduled agent) tailored to their specific needs.

## Workflow

### 1. Present Curated Automation Ideas

Start by presenting 5 concrete automation examples. Make it easy for them to pick something appealing or describe their own idea.

**Popular first automations:**

- **Daily news digest** – Fetch the latest headlines on a topic you care about and email it to you every morning
- **Weekly meeting reminder** – Get an email every Sunday evening listing your meetings for the coming week
- **Inbox zero digest** – Get a daily email summarizing unread messages across your email accounts (count, senders, subjects).
- **Texting positive affirmations daily** – Send yourself a daily text message with a randomly selected or rotating positive affirmation.
- **Scheduled report** – Generate a status report from your notes or tasks and save it as a file on a recurring schedule.

### 2. Ask What They Want to Automate

Ask them which category interests them, or what they'd like to automate. Listen for:

- **What task** do they want automated?
- **How often** should it run? (daily, weekly, on a schedule)
- **What should happen?** (generate a report, send an email, save a file, etc.)
- **Do they have the tools/integrations?** (Gmail, Google Calendar, etc.)

### 3. Clarify & Refine

Ask follow-up questions to understand their exact needs:

- When should it run? (specific time, day of week)
- Should they receive the results over email, text message, or just within Zo?
- Any specific format or content they want included?
- Do they need to set up any app integrations first?

### 4. Set Up the Automation

Once you understand their needs:

1. **Check prerequisites** – Do they have required integrations connected? (Gmail, Google Drive, etc.)
2. **Create the agent** – Use `tool create_scheduled_task` based on their replies.
3. **Finally** – Tell them EXACTLY:

> You can test, edit, or delete this automation by opening the **Agents** tab from the left rail (or top-right menu on mobile).

## Key Tips

- **Avoid open-ended questions**
- **Start simple** – Their first automation should be something they'll see work quickly, building confidence for more complex ones later.
- **Be thorough for more complex tasks** – If the user wants to automate a more complex task, don't rush things. Ensure all the necessary integrations or other required materials are available.
- **Offer integration help** – If they need Gmail, Google Calendar, or other apps, help them connect it first (or note that it's required).
- **Be specific in instructions** – When you create an agent, the instruction should be detailed and actionable. Include file paths, specific tools, and context.
