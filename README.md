# Zo Skills 

Agent Skills Registry for [Zo Computer](https://zo.computer)

Inside Zo, you can browse all the skills in this registry and install them for your agent to use.

# Contributing

## Manual installation

To install a skill manually, run:

```bash
slug="bird"; dest="Skills"; manifest_url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zocomputer/skills/main/manifest.json"; mkdir -p "$dest" && tarball_url="$(curl -fsSL "$manifest_url" | jq -r '.tarball_url')" && archive_root="$(curl -fsSL "$manifest_url" | jq -r '.archive_root')" && curl -L "$tarball_url" | tar -xz -C "$dest" --strip-components=1 "$archive_root/$slug"
```

> Gets repo tarball in temp dir, extracts the skill directory. `archive_root` is the tarball root folder created by GitHub: `<repo>-<branch>`.

## Structure

`bun validate` to ensure all skills follow this structure:

- Each skill is a top-level directory with a required `SKILL.md`.
- Allowed subdirectories: `assets/`, `references/`, `scripts/`.
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter must include `name`, `description`, and `metadata.author`.

## External Skills

- External skills are defined in `external.yml` and pulled from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/docs/cli)
- `bun sync` treats `external.yml` as a transformation layer: it installs skills from the source repo, then applies any overrides before copying into this registry
- Use `notice` to prepend a "Notice" section to the synced `SKILL.md` (Zo-specific setup or constraints)
- Run `bun grab <owner/repo>` to scrape skills.sh and append new skills to `external.yml`
- Run `bun sync` to sync the newest entry in `external.yml` (preferred contributor flow)
- Run `bun sync <slug>` to sync a specific external skill by slug
- Run `bun sync <owner/repo>` to sync all skills from a specific repository
- Run `bun sync all` to sync every external skill in parallel
- Run `bun sync metadata` to update metadata for already-synced skills

## Manifest

- A `manifest.json` lists all the skills along with installation metadata
- Run `bun manifest` to generate the manifest
